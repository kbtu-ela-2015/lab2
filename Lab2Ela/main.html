        <h3>Football Weekly: Chelsea lift the League Cup as Manchester City slip further away</h3>

Chelsea see off Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final, while Liverpool inflict further damage on Manchester City's efforts in the title race.

It's an all-star line up on today's Football Weekly, with AC Jimbo joined by Barry Glendenning, Simon Burnton and big, bad Barney Ronay. Woof and indeed oof!

We start at Wembley, where Chelsea claimed their first trophy of the Mou 2.0 era - and the day couldn't have gone much better for the Blues as Manchester City lost further ground in the title race after they were beaten by Liverpool.

After analysing the rest of the Premier League games at the weekend and over the next two nights, we turn our attention to the outrageously competitive Championship, before rounding off our Odyssey with a whizz around Serie A, Ligue 1, the Bundesliga and La Liga.

We'll be back for more on Thursday - with a bit o' Amy Lawrence, if you ask nicely - and if you're yet to catch up with Barry's interview with Dean Windass, make sure you give it - and the rest of his one-on-one conversations with current- and not-so-current players - a listen on Acast.</p>
